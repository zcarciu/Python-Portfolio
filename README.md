# Python-Portfolio

This repo is a collection of python programs I have created for coursework or other uses. 

* **data\_cleanup.py**, **data\_visualization.py**, **trace\_cleanup.py** and **trace\_summary\_table.py** were some of the programs I used to analyze ping and traceroute data for my networking class. 

* **graphs.py** is an implementation of a graph with some graph algorithms. 
* **test\_graph.py** is used to test the graph

* **MusicRecommender.py** is an unfinished music recommender system that takes a JSON file of tweets as an input.
