# Python-Portfolio

This repo is a collection of python programs I have created for coursework or other uses. 

data_cleanup.py, data_visualization.py, trace_cleanup.py and trace_summary_table.py were some of the programs I used to analyze ping and traceroute data for my networking class. 

graphs.py is an implementation of a graph with some graph algorithms. 
test_graph.py is used to test the graph
